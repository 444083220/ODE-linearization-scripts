# ODE-linearization-scripts
Maple 2020 or higher is required.
If you want to play our algorithms with your own examples, please use 'Example generator.mw' to generate examples. It also helps you to classify your examples, then choose a suitable algorithm to apply.
Alg.2+ is not shown in our paper, it is for case m=n+1 or m=n+2, the linearizing mappings from its output maps its input to an inverse Laguerre-Forsyth form.
